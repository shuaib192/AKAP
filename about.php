            <div class="grid-item">
                <p class="main-paragraph">The Kambari people, predominantly found in Niger and Kebbi states, are one of the most ancient ethnic groups in Nigeria. With a history stretching back centuries, our people have been known for their fierce independence, unique cultural practices, and deep connection to the Niger River basin. Historically organized into various sub-groups and clans, the need for a unified voice in modern Nigeria became increasingly apparent in the late 20th century.</p>
                <p class="main-paragraph">Leaders and elders from across Kambari land came together with a shared purpose: to create a single, unified body that could represent the interests of all Kambari people. After years of consultations and grassroots organizing, the Association of Kambari People was formally inaugurated. Its founding was a landmark moment, symbolizing a new era of cooperation and collective action aimed at navigating the challenges and opportunities of the modern world while holding fast to our ancestral values.</p>
